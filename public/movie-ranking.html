<h1>The Best Movies According to Kat</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Tank Girl</h3>
<p>Lori Petty gives the comic book heroine life in this super fun action packed movie with a killer soundtrack.</p>
<br />
<h3>Interview with the Vampire</h3>
<p>As a huge fan of Anne Rice novels and New Orleans, this has always been one of my fave films.</p>
<br />
<h3>Paul</h3>
<p1>One of the first movies I worked on in the vfx industry, Paul is a comic masterpiece bought to life - an RV trip in the US with a loveable alien along for the ride, what could be better?!</p1>
